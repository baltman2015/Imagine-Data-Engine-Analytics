We're so fancy. Here's the gist:


End goal: you can put in a company name/CIK, potentially multiple to indicate a group of companies to compare, and you get:

1. Downloadable Excel models for the financial statements going back historically as far as possible (also pre-formatted etc)

2. Data Analysis within the peer group or provided list of comps, with ratios, growth rates, etc. already backed out

3. Data Visualizations to better understand and quickly draw insights based on the most commonly used metrics, ratios and peer comparisons
